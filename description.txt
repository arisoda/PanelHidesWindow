Allows you to quickly hide (minimize) the top-most maximized window just by middle-mouse clicking anywhere on the TOP PANEL (not the top bar of a window).

Advantages:
1. You can hide windows more quickly (in a reflex, requiring less accuracy)
2. You can hide ALL maximized windows, even those that don't have a top bar.
3. You can hide a maximized window even if it's BEHIND multiple unmaximized windows)

This extension supports multi-monitors in the sense that it actively(!) does not hide any window that is not on the primary monitor.

PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW. Any critique / suggestion is welcome.

It would be great if someone can add the functionality to support multiple top panels (if someone were to have multiple top panels on different monitors).
