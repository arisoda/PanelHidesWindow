For power-users who often deal with many windows, this extension allows you to quickly hide the TOP-MOST maximized window just by middle-mouse clicking anywhere on the top panel. 
This extension support multi-monitors in the sense that it does not hide any window that is not on the primary monitor. 

It would be great if someone can make that this work on a per-monitor and per-top-panel basis.
