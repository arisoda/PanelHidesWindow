For power-users who often deal with many windows, this extension allows you to quickly hide the TOP-MOST maximized window just by middle-mouse clicking anywhere on the top panel. 
This extension support multi-monitors in the sense that it actively(!) does not hide any window that is not on the primary monitor.

It would be great if someone can add the functionality to support multiple top panels (if someone were to have multiple top panels on different monitors).
